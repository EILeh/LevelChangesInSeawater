LevelChangesInSeawater

The program will analyze the changes in the seawater level in some measuring
station. The user will enter the measurements (i.e. sea levels) to the program
after which the program will calculate some statistical characteristics and
display them to the user. When the program starts it first prints an instruction
for user and then the program starts reading input lines and continues doing
that until the user enters an empty line. The values entered must be numbers,
both integers and real numbers are acceptable. If the user enters less than two
numbers, an error message is printed and the program ends. Otherwise the
program calculates and prints on the screen some characteristic values based on
the data. The characteristics which are calculated and printed are:
- the smallest measurement
- the largest measurement
- median
- mean
- standard deviation
The results are printed with two decimal accuracy.
